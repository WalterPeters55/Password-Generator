# Password-Generator

Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Module 3 challenge.

For this challenge, we were tasked with creating a password generator.

* The web application needs to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters using both capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

* The web application also needed to contain a series of prompts to specify the types of characters the user wanted in the password as well as issue alerts if the users did not meet basic password criteria. 

## Summary 

* This web app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make the password generator.
